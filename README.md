# Book library system

A classic online book library has all the features of a physical library.

Steps to run:
1. npm i
2. npm start

The application will open in localhost.

On first page of the application, the list of books will be displayed and user can search from the list of books.
If the book is not found, an option to add the book will be displayed where he/she can add the book by entering the details.
Also, there is an option to edit the saved books.
